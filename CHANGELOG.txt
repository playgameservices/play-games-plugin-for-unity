        * Play-services-jar-resolver updated to 1.1.  This fixes the

Version 0.9.30
    ** BREAKING CHANGES **
        * `PlayerStats` is now a standalone class,
            rather than a subclass of `PlayGamesLocalUser`.
            All existing references to `PlayGamesLocalUser.PlayerStats`
            should now directly refer to `PlayerStats`.
        * The `NumOfSessions` property in `PlayerStats` has been renamed
            `NumberOfSessions` to be consistent with other properties.
    New Features:
        * Rebase PlayerStats API to use the Play Games C++ SDK.
        * PlayerStats API now supported on iOS.

        * Updated to use GPGS C++ SDK version 2.1.

            on the server side.
        * Updated configuration dialogs exposing the **Require Google Plus** property.
            This property should be false if possible, reducing the number of
            scopes and permissions the player has to allow.  Game developers should
            use PlayGamesPlatform.GetServerAuthCode() to pass the player's OAuth
            credentials to the server, and use Player.Id when possible for a persistent,
            unique identifier for the player rather than email address.
    Bug Fixes:
        * #917 iOS 9, game freeze after closing authentication window.
        * #919 Resolves Android jars even when target is not Android.
        * #868 Avoid memory allocations in the PlayGamesHelperObject.
        * #865 GetIdToken needs to be asynchronous.
Version 0.9.28
        ** BREAKING CHANGES **

        The jar resolution process for importing Play Services has been
        standardized with the other Google plugins.  If you are upgrading
        from 0.9.27, you will need to delete the Assets/GooglePlayGames/Editor
        directory and restart Unity, then re-import version 0.9.28.

    New Features:
        * Integrated Play-services-jar resolver plugin for improved compatibility.
Version 0.9.27a
    Bug Fixes:
        * #809 Unity 5.3 namespace conflict

Version 0.9.25 (codename: frengle)
    11 Sept 2015
    ** BREAKING CHANGES **
       * Cloud Save service (AppState) has been removed.
       * The setup dialog now requires the generated resource data from
            Google Play Developer Console.  This reduces the number of
            copy & pastes needed and makes it harder to make a mistake with the
            client id.
    New Features:
       * Updated Configuration setup using Resource data from Play Console.
       * Added support for exclusiveBitmask in Turnbased quickmatches.

    Bug Fixes:
       * #182 Response to Submit Score or Load Scores
       * #387 OnLeftRoom not called when application is paused
       * #445 Variant error in turn based match
       * #563 Custom UI for invitation UI.
       * #614 OnRoomConnected() getting called twice after implementing ShowWaitingRoomUI
       * #619 NO_GPGS does not work with Symlink Unity libraries
       * #655 Authenticate fails at first, then succeeds second time
Version 0.9.21
  **BREAKING CHANGES**
       * #382 Callback for declined invitation when creating RTMP room
    This change adds the method `OnParticipantLeft` to the
 `RealTimeMultiplayerListener` interface.  Existing games that use this interface
need to add an implementation of this method.
  New Features:
       * #136 Callback for ShowLeaderboardUI()
       * #392 Support for Default waiting room for RTMP
       * #498 Bitmask filter in CreateQuickGame

          cloud save feature, which is deprecated and will be removed. See
          ISavedGameClient.cs for more details.
    API Changes:
        * RTMP Clients will no longer automatically call LeaveRoom when
          they are removed from the connected set. Also, the local player
          will never appear as a participant in
          OnPeersConnected/OnPeersDisconnected.
        * The PlayGamesPlatform must be configured before it can be used.
          See PlayGamesClientConfiguration, PlayGamesPlatform.InitializeInstance,
          and PlayGamesClientFactory.GetPlatformPlayGamesClient.
    Bug Fixes:
        * #309 - LeaderboardManager calls ShowAllUI when using leaderboard id


2014-11-14 Version 0.9.10 (codename: doge)
    This release is a major rearchitecting of the plugin to use
    the Play Games C++ SDK. This allows us to re-use the same code on
    all supported platforms, reducing codesize and decreasing the
    work required to add new features. This release makes few
    developer-facing API changes, apart from those required for
    correctness reasons.

    New features:
        * Post-process build is handled by pure C# code rather than
          bash / shell scripts.
        * Implemented on top of the cross platform C++ Play Games SDK
    API Changes:
        * Conversions from int to uint where applicable:
            - TurnBasedMatch.AvailableAutomatchSlots
            - TurnBasedMatch.Variant
            - IPlayGamesClient.IncrementAchievement
            - IRealTimeMultiplayerClient.CreateQuickGame
            - IRealTimeMultiplayerClient.CreateWithInvitationScreen
            - ITurnBasedMultiplayerClient.CreateQuickGame
            - ITurnBasedMultiplayerClient.CreateWithInvitationScreen
        * Removes support for cloud state on iOS (a crossplatform
          alternative is coming soon).
        * Removes cloud state encrypter (only used by iOS).
        * Real Time multiplayer calls will fail immediately when the
          current match is being left or is shutdown.
        * Turn-based multiplayer APIs now take instances of TurnBasedMatch
          rather than just match ID. This is required for correctness
          (the previous API allowed silently overwriting updated matches).


2014-03-17 Version 0.9.00 (codename: cuiaba)

    New features:
