[ SOURCE OR BINARY? ]

    If you just want to *use* the plugin in your game (as opposed to modify it),
    this directory is the wrong place to look. There is a pre-built and ready-to-use
    version of the plugin in the "current-build" directory. Refer to the root
    README.md file for more information.


[ REPOSITORY CONTENTS ]

    SupportLib/
        Source code for the Java support lib (the JAR file)

    PluginDev/
        Unity project for developing and debugging the plugin

    docgen/
        Source code documentation generation config.


[ HOW TO BUILD THE PLUGIN ]

Gradle is used to coordinate the build process.

1. Remove any old build directory.  It is named `./build`.
2. Make sure you have the environment variables set correctly:
   2.1 ANDROID_NDK_ROOT - points to the Android NDK
   2.2 ANDROID_HOME - points to the Android SDK
   2.3 UNITY_EXE - points to the unity executable.
   2.4 GIT_EXE - points to the git executable.
3. Run the gradle wrapper: `./gradlew`
4. Get a cup of coffee, or tea, or learn a haiku while it builds.
5. It will update the unitypackage in ../current-build and all the unitypackages
    for the samples.

[ KNOWN ISSUES]

1. The plugin will not build on a case-sensitive drive.

2. The plugin will not build if the directory structure contains spaces in any directory name.
