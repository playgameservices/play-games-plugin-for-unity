TO FINISH CONFIGURING THE EXPORTED XCODE PROJECT

1. Add these frameworks:

      AddressBook.framework
      AssetsLibrary.framework
      CoreData.framework
      CoreTelephony.framework
      CoreText.framework
      Security.framework
      libc++.dylib
      libz.dylib

2. Add the following bundles and frameworks from the Google Plus
   and the Google Play Games C++ SDKs. These can be downloaded from
   https://developers.google.com/games/services.

      GoogleOpenSource.framework
      GooglePlus.bundle
      GooglePlus.framework
      GooglePlayGames.bundle
      gpg.framework

   Note: Make sure the bundles are copied to application.  This can be 
    verified under Build Phases/Copy Bundle Resources.

3. Add the '-ObjC' linker flag. To do this, select the top-level project
   object, select the 'Unity-iPhone' build target, then go to the
   Build Settings tab. Search for Other Linker Flags and add
   the '-ObjC' flag to that list.

4. If you want to run the project in the simulator (as opposed to an
   actual device, read the notes in the APPENDIX below.


Your project is now ready to build and deploy!






-- APPENDIX: Running on the simulator. --
You only need to read this section if you intend to run your project
in the simulator, as opposed to an actual device.

By default, the exported Unity project does not support calling native C
functions on the simulator, but those are needed for the Google Play Games
integration. To enable support for them in the simulator, edit the
Libraries/RegisterMonoModules.cpp file.

You will notice there are two sections near the top of the file that
are delimited by #if !(TARGET_IPHONE_SIMULATOR) and #endif.

    extern \"C\" {
        ....
    #if !(TARGET_IPHONE_SIMULATOR)
        .. declarations .. (zone A)
    #endif
    }

    void RegisterMonoModules()
    {
        ...
    #if !(TARGET_IPHONE_SIMULATOR)
        ...function calls... (zone B)
    #endif
    }

To enable the simulator to make the necessary C function calls, you need to:

1. Find the line that declares the mono_dl_register_symbol() function in Zone A.
2. Move it to the outside of Zone A, right after the #endif (but still inside
   the extern \"C\" block)
3. Find ALL the calls to mono_dl_register_symbol() in Zone B.
4. Move them ALL outside Zone B, after the #endif (but still inside
   the RegisterMonoModules() function).

So the final structure should look like:

    extern \"C\" {
        ....
    #if !(TARGET_IPHONE_SIMULATOR)
        .. declarations .. (zone A)
    #endif
        void mono_dl_register_symbol(const char* name, void *addr);
    }

    void RegisterMonoModules()
    {
        ...
    #if !(TARGET_IPHONE_SIMULATOR)
        ...function calls... (zone B)
    #endif
        mono_dl_register_symbol(\"GPGSFooBar1\", (void*)&GPGSFooBar1);
        mono_dl_register_symbol(\"GPGSFooBar2\", (void*)&GPGSFooBar2);
        mono_dl_register_symbol(\"GPGSFooBar3\", (void*)&GPGSFooBar3);
        mono_dl_register_symbol(\"GPGSFooBar4\", (void*)&GPGSFooBar4);
        ....
    }
