  /// <summary>
  /// Defines an abstract interface for a Play Games Client. Concrete implementations
  /// might be, for example, the client for Android or for iOS. One fundamental concept
  /// that implementors of this class must adhere to is stable authentication state.
  /// This means that once Authenticate() returns true through its callback, the user is
  /// considered to be forever after authenticated while the app is running. The implementation
  /// must make sure that this is the case -- for example, it must try to silently
  /// re-authenticate the user if authentication is lost or wait for the authentication
  /// process to get fixed if it is temporarily in a bad state (such as when the
  /// Activity in Android has just been brought to the foreground and the connection to
  /// the Games services hasn't yet been established). To the user of this
  /// interface, once the user is authenticated, they're forever authenticated.
  /// Unless, of course, there is an unusual permanent failure such as the underlying
  /// service dying, in which it's acceptable that API method calls will fail.
  ///
  /// <para>All methods can be called from the game thread. The user of this interface
  /// DOES NOT NEED to call them from the UI thread of the game. Transferring to the UI
  /// thread when necessary is a responsibility of the implementors of this interface.</para>
  ///
  /// <para>CALLBACKS: all callbacks must be invoked in Unity's main thread.
  /// Implementors of this interface must guarantee that (suggestion: use
  /// <see cref="GooglePlayGames.OurUtils.RunOnGameThread(System.Action action)"/>).</para>
