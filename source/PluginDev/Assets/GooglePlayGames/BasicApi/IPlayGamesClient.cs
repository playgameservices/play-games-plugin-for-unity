    /**
     * Defines an abstract interface for a Play Games Client. Concrete implementations
     * might be, for example, the client for Android or for iOS. One fundamental concept
     * that implementors of this class must adhere to is stable authentication state.
     * This means that once Authenticate() returns true through its callback, the user is
     * considered to be forever after authenticated while the app is running. The implementation
     * must make sure that this is the case -- for example, it must try to silently
     * re-authenticate the user if authentication is lost or wait for the authentication
     * process to get fixed if it is temporarily in a bad state (such as when the
     * Activity in Android has just been brought to the foreground and the connection to
     * the Games services hasn't yet been established). To the user of this
     * interface, once the user is authenticated, they're forever authenticated.
     * Unless, of course, there is an unusual permanent failure such as the underlying
     * service dying, in which it's acceptable that API method calls will fail.
     *
     * All methods can be called from the game thread. The user of this interface
     * DOES NOT NEED to call them from the UI thread of the game. Transferring to the UI
     * thread when necessary is a responsibility of the implementors of this interface.
     *
     * CALLBACKS: all callbacks must be invoked in Unity's main thread.
     * Implementors of this interface must guarantee that (suggestion: use
     * GameThreadQueueRunner).
